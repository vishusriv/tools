(1) Q: Can you please explain your UART DCD project?
Sure. Junos support log of disconnect feature. Which means if system is configured with this feature and console is dropped (cable pull out for example)
all the sessions thorugh this console should be cleaned up. Typically, if there are sessions through the console terminal and the console is dropped off,
by default sessions through that console port are not cleaned up.
This causes a wastage of system resources as the sessions are not cleaned up and they are also useless as if console is dropped off, nothing can be done.

HW -- > DCD line --> CPLD --> GPIO--> irq --> driver--> UART core --> sigHup to application  

Generally speaking, what happens is that driver upon detecting DCD is lost on the line, inform the FreeBSD uart core layer. UART core then send the SIGHUP
(Hangup) to the respective application. Application can then do a session clean up which are established though the console terminal in question.
(A) Created interface by modifying GPIO driver code, which can configure the GPIO lines as interrupt lines.
(B) Added driver code to acheive the same.

BUG: First version of the HW was a faulty and was kind of generating interrupts continiously, causing instabilty and crash.
Fix: Probed the UART DCD lines  and verified that it generates spurious  interupts. Discussed the HW team and shown the traces
They fixed it in the HW.

(2) ISSU: How does ISSU works. Can you explain and a high level design flow explainig the details?
ISSU feature allows software upgrade between two Junos versions, without disuption is control path and minimal
disruption is data path.

What are requirements for ISSU: In the plateform there are few must pre-requisite for ISSU to take place.
a > GRES : Graceful Routing Engine Switchover Concepts
======================================================

The graceful Routing Engine switchover (GRES) feature in Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved enables a device with redundant Routing Engines to continue forwarding 
packets even if one Routing Engine fails. GRES preserves interface and kernel information, and traffic is not interrupted. However, GRES does not preserve the
control plane.
Neighboring devices detect that the device has experienced a restart and react to the event in a manner prescribed by individual routing protocol specifications.
To preserve routing during a switchover, GRES must be combined with either:
++Graceful restart protocol extensions
++Nonstop active routing (NSR)

b > NSR :
=========
High availability feature that allows a routing platform with redundant Routing Engines to preserve routing information on the backup
Routing Engine and switch over from the primary Routing Engine to the backup Routing Engine without alerting peer nodes that a change 
has occurred. NSR uses the graceful Routing Engine switchover (GRES) infrastructure to preserve interface, kernel, and routing information.
Also known as nonstop routing (NSR).
