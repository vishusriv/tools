# tools
This directory contains simple implementation of frequently used Linux tools.
A thought is given and own design / implementation is deducted. It's match to
standard tool implementation would _merely_ be an coincidence.

List goes here :

1: shell.c == > simple implemetation of standard "shell" found in linux.
                This code can be tested by using gcc compiler (at least)
                and running the standard o/p.
                something like this == > "gcc shell.c && ./a.out"
                
Next steps are to implement :
1: ls
2: ps
3: clear
4: pwd
5: cat
commands first. Other things would be implemented as an when they are remebered.
Aah, why i have not thought of doing this till now. This should have been my
first order of business in the SW field. But, you are, never _too_ late !
